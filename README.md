# Underwater Acoustics Assignments

This repository contains homework assignments for the Master MIR – Underwater Acoustics course, showcasing studies on sound wave propagation, velocity profiles, and communication methodologies within different oceanic conditions.

## Homework 1 - Arctic Ocean Sound Ray Trajectory

**Author(s):** Ismetcan SARAC, Yosef GUEVARA  
**Date:** January 6, 2023

### Overview
Investigation of sound ray trajectories in the Arctic Ocean using an affine function for velocity depth profiles. The sonar at 600m depth emits a beam within an angular width of 4°, and we analyze the beam trajectory over 30 seconds.

### Key Findings
- The maximum depth reached by the beam is approximately 654.589m at -2°.
- An expression for the round-trip time of a sound wave emitted under vertical incidence is derived.
- Error estimation for depth measurements if a uniform velocity is assumed.

*Velocity profile for the Arctic Ocean with a constant gradient.*

### Simulation Results
The simulation software plots demonstrate the expected trajectories and validate the derived formulas.

## Homework 2 - Mediterranean Sea Sound Ray Communication

**Author(s):** Ismetcan SARAC, Yosef GUEVARA  
**Date:** January 22, 2023

### Overview
A focus on the trajectory of sound rays in the Mediterranean Sea, where a more complex velocity profile exists due to temperature and pressure differences with depth. The goal is to establish communication with another antenna located at a 10 km distance.

### Key Findings
- A communication antenna needs to be located at a depth between 844.391m and 893.465m to receive signals from a 600m deep transmitter.
- The impact of a varying gradient on sound ray paths is examined.

### Communication Path Analysis

### Notes
All simulations were carried out using specified software tools, with provided initial conditions. Results underscore the importance of accounting for varying velocity profiles in underwater acoustic communications.
